# Enhanced Logging Verification Checklist

Use this checklist to verify that the enhanced logging implementation is working correctly across all services.

## Pre-Deployment Verification

### 1. Code Review

- [ ] All Python services import enhanced logging modules correctly
- [ ] All TypeScript services import filters and interceptors correctly
- [ ] Middleware is registered in correct order (logging before CORS)
- [ ] Exception handlers are properly configured
- [ ] No TypeScript compilation errors
- [ ] No Python import errors

### 2. Unit Tests

- [ ] Run enhanced logging test suite: `python tests/test_enhanced_logging.py`
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Sensitive data redaction works correctly
- [ ] Exception formatting includes full stack traces
- [ ] JSON formatter produces valid JSON

### 3. Service-Level Testing

#### Draft Service (Python/FastAPI)

- [ ] Service starts without errors
- [ ] Logs show "Enhanced logging middleware enabled" message
- [ ] Make successful request - verify structured JSON log
- [ ] Make failing request - verify error log with stack trace
- [ ] Verify request ID in logs and response headers
- [ ] Verify sensitive data is redacted

**Test Commands**:
```bash
# Start service
cd services/draft-service
poetry run uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Test successful request
curl -X GET http://localhost:3002/health

# Test with request ID
curl -H "X-Request-ID: test-draft-123" http://localhost:3002/health

# Test error (404)
curl http://localhost:3002/api/v1/drafts/nonexistent
```

#### RAG Service (Python/FastAPI)

npm run dev:speaker

# Test health endpoint
curl -H "X-Request-ID: test-speaker-123" http://localhost:3001/api/v1/health
```

## Log Format Verification

### 4. Structured JSON Logs

For each service, verify logs contain:

- [ ] `timestamp` field (ISO 8601 format)
- [ ] `level` field (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
- [ ] `severity` field
- [ ] `service` field (service name)
- [ ] `environment` field
- [ ] `logger` field (module name)
- [ ] `message` field
- [ ] `request_id` field (for request logs)

**Verification**:
```bash
# Check log is valid JSON
tail -1 logs/service.log | jq .

# Verify required fields
tail -1 logs/service.log | jq 'has("timestamp", "level", "service", "message")'
```

### 5. Request Logging

For each request, verify logs contain:

- [ ] Request received event
- [ ] Request method and path
- [ ] Request headers (sensitive ones redacted)
- [ ] Request body (if POST/PUT/PATCH)
- [ ] Request ID
- [ ] Client IP address

**Verification**:
```bash
# Make a request and check logs
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/api/v1/test \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer secret-token" \
  -d '{"username": "test", "password": "secret123"}'

# Verify authorization is redacted
tail -10 logs/service.log | jq '.request.headers.authorization'
# Should show: "[REDACTED]"

# Verify password is redacted
tail -10 logs/service.log | jq '.request.body.password'
# Should show: "[REDACTED]"
```

### 6. Error Logging

For each error, verify logs contain:

- [ ] Error type
- [ ] Error message
- [ ] Full traceback/stack trace
- [ ] Structured stack frames (file, function, line number)
- [ ] Request context
- [ ] `requires_investigation` flag
- [ ] `alert_priority` field

**Verification**:
```bash
# Trigger an error
curl http://localhost:3002/api/v1/nonexistent

# Check error log structure
tail -10 logs/service.log | jq 'select(.level == "ERROR") | {
  error_type: .error.type,
  has_traceback: (.error.traceback != null),
  has_stack_frames: (.error.stack_frames != null),
  requires_investigation,
  alert_priority
}'
```

### 7. Sensitive Data Redaction

Verify the following are redacted:

- [ ] `password` fields
- [ ] `api_key` fields
- [ ] `token` fields
- [ ] `authorization` headers
- [ ] `secret` fields
- [ ] `credit_card` fields
- [ ] Long alphanumeric strings (potential tokens)

**Test Data**:
```json
{
  "username": "test",
  "password": "secret123",
  "api_key": "sk_live_abc123xyz",
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9",
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "credit_card": "4532-1234-5678-9010"
}
```

**Expected in Logs**:
```json
{
  "username": "test",
  "password": "[REDACTED]",
  "api_key": "[REDACTED]",
  "token": "[REDACTED]",
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "credit_card": "[REDACTED]"
}
```

### 8. Request ID Correlation

- [ ] Request ID generated if not provided
- [ ] Request ID from header used if provided
- [ ] Request ID in all log entries for that request
- [ ] Request ID in response headers
- [ ] Same request ID across service calls

**Verification**:
```bash
# Make request with custom ID
RESPONSE=$(curl -i -H "X-Request-ID: correlation-test-123" http://localhost:3002/health)

# Check response header
echo "$RESPONSE" | grep -i "x-request-id"
# Should show: X-Request-Id: correlation-test-123

# Check logs
grep "correlation-test-123" logs/service.log | jq .request_id
# All entries should have: "correlation-test-123"
```

## Performance Verification

### 9. Performance Impact

- [ ] Measure baseline request latency (without enhanced logging)
- [ ] Measure request latency with enhanced logging
- [ ] Verify impact is acceptable (< 5ms overhead)
- [ ] Check log volume is reasonable
- [ ] Verify no memory leaks

**Measurement**:
```bash
# Baseline (if you have old version)
ab -n 1000 -c 10 http://localhost:3002/health

# With enhanced logging
ab -n 1000 -c 10 http://localhost:3002/health

# Compare results
```

### 10. Log Volume

- [ ] Monitor log file size growth
- [ ] Verify log rotation is working (if configured)
- [ ] Check disk space usage
- [ ] Verify body size limits are respected

## Integration Testing

### 11. Cross-Service Request Tracing

- [ ] Make request through API Gateway to backend service
- [ ] Verify same request ID in both services' logs
- [ ] Verify request context is preserved
- [ ] Verify error propagation works correctly

**Test**:
```bash
# Make request through gateway
curl -H "X-Request-ID: integration-test-123" \
  http://localhost:3000/api/v1/speakers

# Check both gateway and speaker service logs
grep "integration-test-123" logs/api-gateway.log
grep "integration-test-123" logs/speaker-service.log
```

### 12. Error Propagation

- [ ] Trigger error in backend service
- [ ] Verify error logged in backend service
