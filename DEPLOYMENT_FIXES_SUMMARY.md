## Issues Encountered and Resolved

### 1. **Image Not Found Error**

**Problem:**
```
✗ Image not found for speaker-service
❌ Deployment failed
```

**Root Cause:**
- The state file (`.azure-deployment-state.json`) only contained 3 out of 5 Docker images
- Missing images: `api-gateway` and `speaker-service`
- These images failed to build in a previous run due to TypeScript compilation errors

**Resolution:**
- Fixed TypeScript compilation errors (see below)
- Re-ran the build step with `--force-step build_and_push_images`
- All 5 images successfully built and pushed to Azure Container Registry

---

### 2. **TypeScript Compilation Errors**

**Problem:**
Docker builds for `api-gateway` and `speaker-service` failed during production build with the following errors:

```
ERROR in ./libs/common/src/interceptors/logging.interceptor.ts:113:20
TS6133: 'logResponseBody' is declared but its value is never read.

ERROR in ./libs/common/src/interceptors/logging.interceptor.ts:172:21
TS2339: Property 'user' does not exist on type 'Request<ParamsDictionary, any, any, ParsedQs, Record<string, any>>'.

ERROR in ./libs/common/src/interceptors/logging.interceptor.ts:237:5
TS6133: 'response' is declared but its value is never read.

ERROR in ./libs/common/src/filters/global-exception.filter.ts:127:19
TS2339: Property 'user' does not exist on type 'Request<ParamsDictionary, any, any, ParsedQs, Record<string, any>>'.
```

**Root Cause:**
- TypeScript strict mode in production builds fails on:
  - Unused variables/parameters
  - Missing type definitions for Express Request extensions

**Resolution:**

#### Fix 1: `libs/common/src/interceptors/logging.interceptor.ts`

**Added Express Request type augmentation:**
```typescript
// Extend Express Request type to include user property
declare module 'express' {
  interface Request {
    user?: any;
  }
}
```

**Removed unused `logResponseBody` field:**
```typescript
// Before:
private readonly logResponseBody: boolean;

// After:
// Removed - parameter kept in constructor for backward compatibility
```

**Fixed constructor to use underscore prefix for unused parameter:**
```typescript
constructor(
  logRequestBody: boolean = true,
  _logResponseBody: boolean = false, // Prefixed with _ to indicate intentionally unused
  maxBodySize: number = 10000,
) {
  this.logRequestBody = logRequestBody;
  // logResponseBody parameter kept for backward compatibility but not used
  this.maxBodySize = maxBodySize;
}
```

**Fixed unused `response` parameter in `logError` method:**
```typescript
private logError(
  request: Request,
  _response: Response, // Prefixed with _ to indicate intentionally unused
  requestId: string,
  duration: number,
  error: any,
): void {
```

#### Fix 2: `libs/common/src/filters/global-exception.filter.ts`

**Added Express Request type augmentation:**
```typescript
// Extend Express Request type to include user property
declare module 'express' {
  interface Request {
    user?: any;
  }
}
```

### 3. **Container Apps Deployer Not Initialized**

**Problem:**
```
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'deploy_container_app'
```

**Root Cause:**
- `container_apps_deployer` is initialized in `_step_deploy_infrastructure_services`
- When that step is skipped (already completed), the deployer remains `None`
- `_step_deploy_application_services` tries to use the uninitialized deployer

**Resolution:**

Added initialization check in `scripts/azure/deployer.py`:

```python
def _step_deploy_application_services(self) -> bool:
    """Deploy application services."""
    print_step(11, 15, "Deploying Application Services")

    # Initialize Container Apps deployer if not already initialized
    # (can happen if deploy_infrastructure_services step was skipped)
    if not hasattr(self, 'container_apps_deployer') or self.container_apps_deployer is None:
        registry_info = self.state['created_resources']['container_registry']
        env_name = self.state['created_resources']['container_apps_env']['name']
        
        self.container_apps_deployer = ContainerAppsDeployer(
            self.config,
            self.config['azure']['resource_group'],
            env_name,
            registry_info,
            self.logger,
            self.dry_run
        )

    # Get environment variables from state
    env_vars = self._build_environment_variables()
    # ... rest of the method
```

## Files Modified

### TypeScript Fixes
1. ✅ `libs/common/src/interceptors/logging.interceptor.ts`
   - Added Express Request type augmentation
   - Removed unused `logResponseBody` field
   - Prefixed unused parameters with `_`

2. ✅ `libs/common/src/filters/global-exception.filter.ts`
   - Added Express Request type augmentation

### Deployment Script Fixes
3. ✅ `scripts/azure/deployer.py`
   - Added `container_apps_deployer` initialization check in `_step_deploy_application_services`

---

## Deployment Architecture

The deployment uses a **single consolidated script**:

- **Main Script:** `scripts/deploy-azure_v1.py`
  - Idempotent deployment with state management
  - Automatic retry/resume from failed steps
  - Uses decorator pattern for step tracking

- **Supporting Modules:**
  - `scripts/azure/deployer.py` - Core deployment logic (DraftGenieDeployer class)
  - `scripts/azure/docker_builder.py` - Docker image building
  - `scripts/azure/container_apps.py` - Container Apps deployment
  - `scripts/azure/env_configurator.py` - Environment variable configuration
  - `scripts/azure/utils.py` - Utility functions

- **Legacy Script (Not Used):**
  - `scripts/deploy-azure.py` - Old non-idempotent version (kept for reference)

---

## Deployment Results

✅ **All 5 Docker images built and pushed successfully:**
- api-gateway
- speaker-service
- draft-service
- rag-service
- evaluation-service

✅ **All 5 application services deployed:**
- speaker-service ✓
- draft-service ✓
- rag-service ✓
- evaluation-service ✓
- api-gateway ✓

✅ **All services running and healthy**

## Key Learnings

1. **TypeScript Strict Mode:** Production builds enforce strict type checking
   - Always add proper type augmentations for Express Request extensions
   - Prefix intentionally unused parameters with `_` to satisfy TypeScript

2. **Idempotent Deployment:** The script's retry/resume functionality works as designed
   - Automatically skips completed steps
   - Detects dependency changes via SHA-256 hashing
   - Safe to run multiple times

3. **State Management:** Proper initialization checks are critical
   - Always verify dependencies are initialized before use
   - Handle cases where steps are skipped due to idempotency

---

## Testing

After deployment, verify with:

```bash
# Test all services
./scripts/azure/test-deployed-services.sh

# Check health endpoint
curl https://api-gateway.gentleforest-322351b3.southindia.azurecontainerapps.io/api/v1/health

# View Swagger docs
open https://api-gateway.gentleforest-322351b3.southindia.azurecontainerapps.io/api/docs
```

---

## Next Steps

1. **Run Database Migrations:**
   ```bash
   # Speaker Service (Prisma)
   cd apps/speaker-service && npx prisma migrate deploy

   # Draft Service (Alembic)
   cd services/draft-service && poetry run alembic upgrade head

   # RAG Service (Alembic)
   cd services/rag-service && poetry run alembic upgrade head

   # Evaluation Service (Alembic)
   cd services/evaluation-service && poetry run alembic upgrade head
   ```

2. **Monitor Services:**
   - Check Azure Portal for service health
   - Review logs in Azure Log Analytics
   - Monitor resource usage and scaling

3. **Set Up CI/CD:**
   - Automate deployments via GitHub Actions
   - Add automated testing before deployment
   - Implement blue-green deployment strategy
