## 🚀 Ready to Deploy

The deployment script is now ready for production use. Here's how to use it:

### Standard Deployment
```bash
python3 scripts/deploy-azure.py --config scripts/azure/config.yaml
```

### With Verbose Logging (Recommended)
```bash
python3 scripts/deploy-azure.py --verbose
```

### Resume from Failure
```bash
python3 scripts/deploy-azure.py --resume
```

### Dry Run (Test First)
```bash
python3 scripts/deploy-azure.py --dry-run
```

## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before running the deployment, ensure:

- [x] ✅ Azure CLI installed and logged in (`az login`)
- [x] ✅ Docker Desktop running
- [x] ✅ Configuration file exists (`scripts/azure/config.yaml`)
- [x] ✅ Gemini API key set in config
- [x] ✅ Appropriate Azure permissions
- [x] ✅ All code changes committed (optional but recommended)

## 🎓 Lessons Applied

All lessons from the successful shell script implementations:

1. ✅ Architecture mismatch → AMD64 platform flag
2. ✅ Credential helper → PATH fix
3. ✅ Build failures → Enhanced error handling
4. ✅ Manual testing → Automated verification
5. ✅ Limited logging → Comprehensive logging
6. ✅ Generic errors → Detailed error messages

## 🧪 Testing

### Validation Script
```bash
python3 scripts/azure/validate-deployment-script.py
```

### Dry Run
```bash
python3 scripts/deploy-azure.py --dry-run
```

### Full Deployment
```bash
python3 scripts/deploy-azure.py --verbose
```

### Post-Deployment Testing
```bash
./scripts/azure/test-deployed-services.sh
```
