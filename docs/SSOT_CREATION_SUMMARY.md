## Files Updated

### README.md
Updated to:
- Reference the SSOT document prominently at the top
- Explain the hybrid polyglot architecture
- Update technology stack section
- Update implementation status with current phase
- Add links to additional resources

## Files Removed

The following redundant files were deleted as their content is now fully incorporated into the SSOT:
- ‚úÖ `docs/HYBRID_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- ‚úÖ `docs/UPDATED_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
- ‚úÖ `docs/HYBRID_ARCHITECTURE_SUMMARY.md`

## Files Preserved

These files serve different purposes and were kept:
- ‚úÖ `README.md` - Quick start guide and project overview
- ‚úÖ `docs/SETUP.md` - Detailed installation instructions
- ‚úÖ `docs/GETTING_STARTED.md` - Developer onboarding guide
- ‚úÖ `docs/PHASE1_COMPLETION.md` - Historical record of Phase 1
- ‚úÖ `docs/draft-genie-system-documentation.md` - Original requirements document

## Maintenance

### Updating the SSOT
When making changes to the system:
1. Update the SSOT document first
2. Update code to match the SSOT
3. Update version number in Document History (Section 15)
4. Commit both documentation and code changes together

### Keeping It Current
- Update implementation status as phases complete
- Add new sections as needed
- Update examples when patterns change
- Keep troubleshooting guide current with new issues

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Phase 2** - Python shared libraries (domain, database)
2. **Update SSOT** - Mark Phase 2 tasks as complete when done
3. **Begin Phase 3** - Speaker Service implementation
4. **Keep SSOT updated** - As each phase progresses

## Conclusion

The SSOT document (`docs/system_architecture_and_implementation_plan.md`) is now the authoritative source for all technical information about DraftGenie. It consolidates architecture, implementation plan, development guidelines, and operational procedures into one comprehensive, well-structured document that serves all stakeholders.

All redundant documentation has been removed, and the README.md has been updated to prominently reference the SSOT as the primary technical reference.
