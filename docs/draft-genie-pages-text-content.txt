DRAFT GENIE SYSTEM DOCUMENTATION - TEXT CONVERSION
=================================================

This file contains the text representation of the Draft Genie system documentation,
likely corresponding to the content shown in draft-genie-page-1.png and draft-genie-page-2.png.

SYSTEM OVERVIEW
===============

Draft Genie is a Speaker-centric system that begins with Speaker onboarding, then pulls
Speaker-specific InstaNote ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) drafts and applies
user-specific corrections using AI/ML techniques to produce improved final notes.

HIGH-LEVEL FLOW (SPEAKER-CENTRIC)
=================================

1. Start Speaker Onboarding (SSA/BSA) → Choose Mode
2. Get Speaker Info & Metadata (SER, WER, Buckets)
3. Pull Speaker-specific ASR Drafts (AD) from InstaNote
4. Fetch Historical Drafts (ASR + Final Notes) for the Speaker
5. Create Correction Vector Entries for the Speaker
6. Check for Duplicate Errors → Store Speaker Data in DraftGenie DB
7. Apply User-Specific Corrections using Speaker's Correction Vectors
8. Invoke RAG Service with Speaker Context & Historical Data
9. Produce Draft Genie Final Note (DFN)
10. Store DFN in DB
11. Draft Comparison Service → Compare DFN vs InstaNote Final Notes (IFN)
12. Evaluation Service → Generate Quality Metrics
13. Speaker Bucket Reassignment based on Quality Metrics
14. Business Dashboard Update

SPEAKER ADDITION PROCESS
========================

Single Speaker Addition (SSA) / Bulk Speaker Addition (BSA) Flow:

1. Start Speaker Addition → Choose Mode
2. Mode Options:
   - Single Speaker Addition (SSA) → Get Speaker Info
   - Bulk Speaker Addition (BSA) → Loop SSA for each Speaker

3. Get Speaker Info → Fetch Metadata: SER, WER, Buckets
4. Fetch Metadata → Fetch Historical Drafts (ASR + Final Note)
5. Fetch Historical Drafts → Create Correction Vector Entries
6. Create Correction Vector Entries → Check for Duplicate Errors
7. Check for Duplicate Errors → Store Speaker Data in DraftGenie DB
8. Store Speaker Data → Speaker Successfully Added → End

BUCKET ASSIGNMENT FLOW
======================

1. Speaker Info → Historical Drafts
2. Historical Drafts → Correction Vector Creation
3. Correction Vector Creation → Draft Genie Eval Service
4. Draft Genie Eval Service → Compare IFN vs DFN
5. Compare IFN vs DFN → Quality Metrics
6. Quality Metrics → Bucket Assignment
7. Bucket Assignment → Dashboard Update
