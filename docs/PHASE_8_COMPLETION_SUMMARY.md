## Implementation Details

### 1. Docker Configuration Fixes (CRITICAL)

**Problem:** Python services had incorrect Node.js-based Dockerfiles

**Solution:** Created proper Python-based multi-stage Dockerfiles

#### Fixed Dockerfiles:

**`docker/Dockerfile.draft-service`**
- Multi-stage build with Python 3.11
- Poetry for dependency management
- Production-optimized (builder + runtime stages)
- Non-root user for security
- Health check included
- Port 3002 exposed

**`docker/Dockerfile.rag-service`**
- Multi-stage build with Python 3.11
- LangChain and LangGraph dependencies
- Production-optimized
- Non-root user for security
- Health check included
- Port 3003 exposed

**`docker/Dockerfile.evaluation-service`** (NEW)
- Multi-stage build with Python 3.11
- Poetry for dependency management
- Production-optimized
- Non-root user for security
- Health check included
- Port 3004 exposed

#### Updated docker-compose.yml:

- Fixed Draft Service configuration (Python environment variables)
- Fixed RAG Service configuration (Python environment variables)
- Added Evaluation Service (complete configuration)
- Updated service dependencies
- Fixed environment variable names (NODE_ENV → ENVIRONMENT for Python services)
- Added service-to-service URLs

**Result:** All services now start successfully via `docker-compose up`

## CI/CD Pipeline Configuration

### GitHub Actions Workflows

**CI Pipeline:**
- Runs on: Push to main/develop, Pull Requests
- Jobs: Lint, Test Node.js, Test Python, Integration Tests, Build Docker, Security Scan
- Duration: ~15-20 minutes
- Status: ✅ Configured and ready

**CD Pipeline:**
- Runs on: Push to main, Version tags, Manual trigger
- Jobs: Build & Push, Deploy Dev/Staging/Prod, Migrations, Release
- Environments: Development, Staging, Production
- Status: ✅ Configured and ready

### Secrets Required

Configure in GitHub repository settings:
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` - Google Gemini API key
- `DATABASE_URL` - Production PostgreSQL URL
- `MONGODB_URL` - Production MongoDB URL
- Additional cloud provider secrets (AWS, GCP, Azure)

---

## Docker Fixes Applied

### Before (Broken):

```dockerfile
# docker/Dockerfile.draft-service (OLD)
FROM node:20-alpine
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci
CMD ["npm", "run", "dev:draft"]
```

### After (Fixed):

```dockerfile
# docker/Dockerfile.draft-service (NEW)
FROM python:3.11-slim AS builder
RUN pip install poetry==1.7.1
COPY services/draft-service/pyproject.toml poetry.lock ./
RUN poetry install --no-root --only main

FROM python:3.11-slim
COPY --from=builder /usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages /usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages
COPY services/draft-service/app ./app
USER fastapi
CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "3002"]
```

**Result:** All Python services now use correct Python-based Dockerfiles

---

## Known Limitations

1. **API Gateway Tests:** Require TypeScript strict mode fixes to run
2. **Test Coverage:** Python services below 70% target (46-54%)
3. **Integration Tests:** Require all services running (Docker Compose)
4. **AI Tests:** Marked with `@pytest.mark.requires_ai` (need Gemini API key)
5. **Deployment Scripts:** Placeholder commands (need cloud-specific implementation)
