```
apps/                    # Node.js services
  └── speaker-service/   # ✅ Complete
services/                # Python services
  ├── draft-service/     # ✅ Complete
  ├── rag-service/       # ✅ Complete
  ├── evaluation-service/# ✅ Complete
  └── api-gateway/       # ❌ Not Implemented
```

### 5. Docker Configuration Updates

**Section 8.1 - Docker Directory:**
- Marked docker-compose.yml as needing updates
- Flagged Dockerfile.draft-service as incorrect (Node.js config for Python service)
- Flagged Dockerfile.rag-service as incorrect (Node.js config for Python service)
- Marked Dockerfile.evaluation-service as missing

### 6. Schema Documentation Updates

**Section 8.1 - Schemas Directory:**
- Added status for each OpenAPI spec file
- Marked common.yaml and speaker-service.yaml as complete
- Marked draft-service.yaml, rag-service.yaml, evaluation-service.yaml as missing
- Added all event schema files with complete status

### 7. Phase Detail Enhancements

**Added to Each Completed Phase:**

- Actual completion dates

**Example - Phase 5:**
```
Status: ✅ Complete (2025-10-06)
Test Results: 13/13 tests passing (100%), 49% coverage
Location: services/rag-service/
Completion Document: docs/PHASE_5_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md
```

### 8. Timeline Updates

**Section 1.4 - Timeline:**
- Expanded from 3 lines to 8 lines showing all phases
- Added explicit status for each phase
- Changed from generic "Phases 3-8: Service Implementation" to individual phase status

### 9. Document Changelog Added

**Section 15: Document Changelog**

## Critical Issues Documented

### 1. Docker Configuration Mismatch
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Files:** 
- `docker/Dockerfile.draft-service`
- `docker/Dockerfile.rag-service`
- `docker/Dockerfile.evaluation-service`
- `docker/docker-compose.yml`

**Issue:** Python services have Node.js Dockerfiles, preventing deployment

### 2. API Gateway Not Implemented
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** No authentication, no single entry point, not production-ready

### 3. Missing OpenAPI Specifications
**Severity:** MAJOR  
**Files Missing:**
- `schemas/openapi/draft-service.yaml`
- `schemas/openapi/rag-service.yaml`
- `schemas/openapi/evaluation-service.yaml`

### 4. No CI/CD Pipeline
**Severity:** MAJOR  
**Impact:** Manual testing and deployment only

### 5. Test Coverage Below Target
**Severity:** MINOR  
**Target:** 70% minimum  
**Actual:** 46-54% for Python services

---

## Verification Process

The following verification steps were performed:

1. ✅ Reviewed all service directories (`apps/`, `services/`)
2. ✅ Checked all Docker configuration files
3. ✅ Verified schema files in `schemas/` directory
4. ✅ Reviewed all phase completion documents
5. ✅ Checked test results for each service
6. ✅ Verified database configurations
7. ✅ Reviewed event infrastructure
8. ✅ Checked API endpoint implementations

---

## Impact Assessment

### Positive Impacts
- **Accurate Status:** Stakeholders now have correct project status
- **Issue Visibility:** Critical deployment issues are clearly documented
- **Action Plan:** Clear prioritized next steps provided
- **Transparency:** All technical debt is documented

### Areas Requiring Attention
- **Docker Deployment:** Cannot deploy via Docker Compose (critical)
- **Production Readiness:** Missing API Gateway blocks production deployment
- **Testing:** No integration tests for complete workflows
- **Documentation:** Missing OpenAPI specs for Python services

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Week 1)
1. Fix Docker configuration for Python services
2. Update docker-compose.yml with correct paths
3. Create missing Dockerfile for evaluation-service
4. Test full Docker Compose deployment

### Short-term (Weeks 2-3)
1. Implement API Gateway (Phase 7)
2. Generate and add missing OpenAPI specifications
3. Add integration test suite (Phase 8)
4. Setup CI/CD pipeline

### Long-term (Month 2+)
1. Improve test coverage to 70%+
2. Implement BSA (Batch Speaker Addition)
3. Production hardening (monitoring, backups, security)

## Files Modified

1. `docs/system_architecture_and_implementation_plan.md` - Main SSOT document

## Files Created

1. `docs/SSOT_UPDATE_2025-10-06.md` - This summary document

---

## Conclusion

The SSOT document now accurately reflects the current state of the Draft Genie project. While Phases 1-6 are successfully completed with functional microservices, critical deployment issues and missing components (API Gateway, integration tests) must be addressed before production deployment.

The updated document provides clear visibility into:
- What's been accomplished (6/8 phases complete)
- What's broken (Docker configuration)
- What's missing (API Gateway, integration tests)
- What needs to be done next (prioritized action items)

This transparency enables informed decision-making and proper resource allocation for completing the remaining work.

**Document Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Review Status:** ✅ Verified  
**Next Review:** After Phase 7 completion
