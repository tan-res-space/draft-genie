# Azure Deployment Script Updates

## Summary

The `deploy-azure.py` Python deployment script has been updated with all lessons learned from successfully fixing the Docker build and push issues. The updates ensure reliable, production-ready deployment to Azure Container Apps.

## Key Updates

### 1. Docker Builder (`scripts/azure/docker_builder.py`)

#### Architecture Fix - AMD64 Platform Support
- **Issue**: Images were being built for ARM64 (Apple Silicon) but Azure Container Apps requires AMD64
- **Fix**: Added `--platform linux/amd64` flag to all Docker build commands
- **Location**: `build_image()` method, line ~200

```python
cmd = [
    'docker', 'build',
    '--platform', 'linux/amd64',  # CRITICAL: Build for AMD64 architecture
    '-f', str(dockerfile_path),
    '-t', image_name
]
```

#### Docker Credential Helper Fix
- **Issue**: `docker-credential-desktop` not found in PATH
- **Fix**: Added method to ensure Docker Desktop bin directory is in PATH
- **Location**: `_ensure_docker_desktop_in_path()` method, line ~75

```python
def _ensure_docker_desktop_in_path(self):
    """Ensure Docker Desktop bin directory is in PATH."""
    docker_desktop_bin = "/Applications/Docker.app/Contents/Resources/bin"
    
    if os.path.exists(docker_desktop_bin):
        current_path = os.environ.get('PATH', '')
        if docker_desktop_bin not in current_path:
            os.environ['PATH'] = f"{docker_desktop_bin}:{current_path}"
```

#### Enhanced Logging and Error Handling
- **Added**: Comprehensive logging at each step of build and push process
- **Added**: Detailed error messages with full stack traces
- **Added**: Progress indicators for each service
- **Added**: Summary report showing successful and failed services

**Key improvements in `build_and_push_all()` method:**
- Platform information displayed upfront
- Registry and service count shown
- Individual service progress with step numbers
- Try-catch blocks around each service build
- Detailed summary with success/failure counts
- Proper exception logging

### 2. Deployment Orchestrator (`scripts/azure/deployer.py`)

#### Service Testing After Deployment
- **Added**: Automated service verification using Azure CLI
- **Added**: Health check testing for API Gateway
- **Added**: Service status reporting (Running/Not Running)
- **Location**: `_step_verify_deployment()` method, line ~543

**New verification features:**
1. Checks each service's running status
2. Retrieves and displays service URLs
3. Tests API Gateway health endpoint (`/api/v1/health`)
4. Provides summary of running services
5. Shows helpful commands for further testing

```python
# Tests each service
for service_name in services_to_test:
    # Check container app status
    # Get service URL
    # Test health endpoint (for API Gateway)
    # Display results
```

#### Enhanced Error Reporting
- **Added**: Import of `run_command` utility for service testing
- **Added**: JSON parsing for service status information
- **Added**: Graceful error handling for missing services

## Configuration Compatibility

All updates maintain full compatibility with existing `config.yaml` structure:
- Uses same service definitions
- Uses same Docker configuration
- Uses same Azure resource settings
- No breaking changes to configuration format

## Testing Integration

The updated script now integrates with the existing test infrastructure:
- Automatically runs service verification after deployment
- Provides URLs for manual testing
- Suggests running `./scripts/azure/test-deployed-services.sh` for comprehensive testing
- Displays Swagger documentation URL

## Deployment Flow

The complete deployment flow remains unchanged (14 steps):

1. ✅ Check Prerequisites
2. ✅ Create Resource Group
3. ✅ Create Monitoring Infrastructure
4. ✅ Create Container Registry
5. ✅ Create Key Vault
6. ✅ Create Database Services
7. ✅ Store Secrets in Key Vault
8. ✅ Create Container Apps Environment
9. ✅ **Build and Push Docker Images** (UPDATED with AMD64 support)
10. ✅ Deploy Infrastructure Services
11. ✅ Deploy Application Services
12. ✅ Run Database Migrations
13. ✅ **Verify Deployment and Test Services** (UPDATED with automated testing)
14. ✅ Create Deployment Summary

## Benefits

### Reliability
- ✅ Correct architecture (AMD64) for Azure Container Apps
- ✅ Proper credential handling for Docker registry
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and recovery

### Observability
- ✅ Detailed logging at each step
- ✅ Progress indicators for long-running operations
- ✅ Clear error messages with actionable information
- ✅ Summary reports for build and deployment status

### Maintainability
- ✅ Single Python script for entire deployment
- ✅ Consistent with shell script fixes
- ✅ Well-documented code with inline comments
- ✅ Modular design for easy updates

### Production-Ready
- ✅ Automated service verification
- ✅ Health check testing
- ✅ Proper state management for resume capability
- ✅ Dry-run mode for testing

## Usage

### Standard Deployment
```bash
python scripts/deploy-azure.py --config scripts/azure/config.yaml
```

### With Verbose Logging
```bash
python scripts/deploy-azure.py --verbose
```

### Resume from Failure
```bash
python scripts/deploy-azure.py --resume
```

### Dry Run (Preview)
```bash
python scripts/deploy-azure.py --dry-run
```

## Verification

After deployment, the script will:
1. Show status of all deployed services
2. Display service URLs
3. Test API Gateway health endpoint
4. Provide summary of deployment
5. Suggest next steps for testing

Example output:
```
========================================
Deployment Verification Summary
========================================
Services running: 5/5

API Gateway URL: https://api-gateway.gentleforest-322351b3.southindia.azurecontainerapps.io
Health Check: https://api-gateway.gentleforest-322351b3.southindia.azurecontainerapps.io/api/v1/health
Swagger Docs: https://api-gateway.gentleforest-322351b3.southindia.azurecontainerapps.io/api/docs

To test all services, run:
  ./scripts/azure/test-deployed-services.sh
```

## Lessons Learned Applied

All fixes from the successful shell script implementations have been incorporated:

1. ✅ **Architecture Mismatch**: `--platform linux/amd64` flag added
2. ✅ **Docker Credential Helper**: PATH updated with Docker Desktop bin
3. ✅ **Nx Build Issues**: Handled by Dockerfiles (no changes needed in Python)
4. ✅ **TypeScript Compilation**: Handled by Dockerfiles (no changes needed in Python)
5. ✅ **Poetry Version**: Handled by Dockerfiles (no changes needed in Python)
6. ✅ **Poetry Lock Files**: Handled by Dockerfiles (no changes needed in Python)

## Next Steps

1. Test the updated deployment script in a clean environment
2. Verify all services deploy successfully
3. Confirm health checks pass
4. Document any additional issues encountered
5. Update CI/CD pipelines to use the updated script

## Files Modified

- `scripts/azure/docker_builder.py` - Docker build and push logic
- `scripts/azure/deployer.py` - Main deployment orchestrator
- `scripts/azure/DEPLOYMENT_SCRIPT_UPDATES.md` - This documentation

## Backward Compatibility

✅ All changes are backward compatible with existing deployments
✅ No changes required to configuration files
✅ Existing state files will work with updated script
✅ Can resume from previous deployment states
